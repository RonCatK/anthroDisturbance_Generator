# Overview

This is a module to generate anthropogenic disturbances. It's primarily intended for the Northwest Territories region (default), but the structure is universal. All needed to do is provide the metadata information required by the `disturbanceParameters` object and the `disturbanceList` containing current disturbances and potential disturbances (i.e., for disturbances of Generating type, explained below).
